## Reflection
This design thinking project has strong impact on my goal because it trains me to solve a real problem by focusing on human needs. Through this project, I learned that technology should not only be advanced but it is also have to be meaningful and user-centered. This experience aligns with my dream which is to improve healthcare and quality of life. Design thinking encourages empathy, allowing me to better understand the challenges faced by children with disorders, their parents, and educators.
